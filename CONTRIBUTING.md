# Contributing to Power BI Theme Templates

:tada: First off, thanks for supporting this Power BI community project! :tada:

This project is not associated with any company - it's a compilation of useful samples to help others understand how the theme templates work.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project, which is currently hosted by [MattRudy](https://github.com/mattrudy) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Power BI Theme Templates. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which file(s) your bug is related to, create an issue on this repository and provide all relevant information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining or copying the template you used when you encountered the issue.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

### Suggesting Enhancements

You can suggest an enhancement using the same steps in the 'submitting a bug report' section above.
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Power BI, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this repository? You can start by looking through these `unassigned` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Unassigned issues](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee) - issues which no one is currently working on.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) - issues which we specifically want help with.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

#### Local development

All theme files should be developed and tested on your local machine, in a new branch, before being submitted as a Pull Request to this repository for review.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the quality of this repository
- Fix problems that are important to all of us
- Enable a sustainable system for the repository's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the pull request template (coming soon)
2. Follow the styleguides (coming soon)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
